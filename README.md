# DFA_NFA_practice
This purpose of this project is to practice writing programs to build finite automaton.<br />

I learned the concepts of finite automaton through classes but did not build any by programming.
Then, I discover the book "Algorithms, 4th Edition" contains one chapter about building finite automaton on specific topics such as pattern searching and regular expression.<br />
Therefore, this project will first follow the book then explore the finite automatons.
